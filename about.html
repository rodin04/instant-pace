            <b><u>About Me</u></b><br>
            Hi! I'm a student and passionate software developer from Germany.
            I love building creative digital solutions and useful tools that make everyday life easier.

            <b><u>Know Your Pace – Instantly!</u></b><br>
            Track your runs by simply entering the number of runs you’ve done. 
            The tool will then generate rows where you can enter the distance and time for each run. 
            After that, it automatically calculates your pace, m/s, km/h, splits for each run, and much more — even your overall averages.

            <b><u>What Makes This Project Unique</u></b><br>
            This pace calculator is simple, fast, and easy to use. 
            Many other tools are full of ads or confusing layouts — mine is clean and focused. 
            Whether you're just starting to run or training for a marathon, this tool helps you calculate and understand your running pace without any distractions.

            <b><u>Visions for the Future</u></b><br>
            I'm constantly learning and improving. I plan to expand this platform with more details and maybe open-source contributions in the future.

            <b><u>Why I Built This Tool</u></b><br>
            I built this tool because I couldn’t find a simple, clean, and ad-free pace calculator for my own runs — so I decided to make one myself.

            <b><u>Built with</u></b><br>
            I created this tool using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It works smoothly on both computers and phones.
